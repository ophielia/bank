Bootstrap!

	old pages - transactions, edit transaction, category, edit category, 
	target & target details, category rules, import, category rules
	new thing - quickgroups
aggregate puzzle

check / take care of column manager - still Hib

remove hard copy dojo scripts
look at failed maven all tests
make edit link in expenselist polite
future - change to JPA criteria!!?? (SearchService)
	
done - continue entering categories - start with other subcategories
done - graphical representation of categorylevels - to check!!

starting reports
 misc.  validation for different reports

------>  make input and output pages for monthlytargetreport
done - input page
--> error loading targets - MonthlyTargetsReport.java:110 LazyInitialization
make output page
	
	



discomfort in category entry - 
	all categories should be shown, regardless of display setting
	display should be default true.
	list display in alphabetical order
	list BOX in alphabetical order
	error create with no parent id
	select box in create and edit should be display all, not display only 


ColumnManagerService displayonly should change sql depending upon true or false


think about menu.... make second level for categories, rules, targets
	<li><moo:menulink label="menu_top_menuplans" url="/" />Transactions</li>
	<li><moo:menulink label="menu_top_menuplans" url="/" />Import</li>
	<li><moo:menulink label="menu_top_menuplans" url="/" />Maintain Categories</li>
	<li><moo:menulink label="menu_top_menuplans" url="/" />Monthly Targets</li>
	<li><moo:menulink label="menu_top_menuplans" url="/" />Yearly Targets</li>
	<li><moo:menulink label="menu_top_menuplans" url="/" />Maintain Rules</li>
	<li><moo:menulink label="menu_top_menuplans" url="/" />Assign By Rules</li>

Notes: 

1: CategoryTADao created on ids and not Entities.  Keep this way?? Yes - so many recursives.  might get coomplicated with objects.

Later Development

1. separate different target types into different pages - monthly and yearly.
2. TargetGroup - put monthtag and yeartag into same field.
3. fuzziness with importclient in importmanager.  Would need to be handled much differently in a multiuserenvironment
4. keyword search in expenselist
5. bug in create target - when adding detail....
6. copy target group
